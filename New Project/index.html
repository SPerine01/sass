<h1>Sassy!</h1>

<p>
	I'm sassy! <br>
	I'm the first girl to scream on a track <br>
	I switched up the beat of the drum <br>
	That's right I brought all the boys to the yard <br>
	And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
</p>

<p>
	I'm sassy! <br>
	I'm the chick they love to hate <br>
	I'm the chick that's raised the stakes <br>
	I told John Sterling he should switch debate <br>
	I'm back with an 808 cuz I'm sassy!

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill <br>
